                As students transitioned to online learning, there were an increasing amount of barriers to staying motivated
                and on track in self-paced courses. I was given the opportunity to motivate students struggling with online learning.
                Focus is a web browser extension helping students stay productive by providing incentives and creating a sense of community. 
                This extension is offers many features that allow for individuals to connect and stay motivated such as the meditation feature
                or rewards and point system.
