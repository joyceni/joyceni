                My Lil'Healthbot is a 24/7 autonomous vending machine company that provides on-demand 
                health necessities, products, and services to university students. Recently, the company 
                developed an app that allows students to order everyday necessities through their smartphone. 
                To promote their new app, I designed new banners for their social media platforms and previews
                for the app store. I wanted it to be modern and have minimalist look that would correlate with 
                their colour scheme and branding.
